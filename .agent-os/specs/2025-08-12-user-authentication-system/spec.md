> Spec: User Authentication System
> Created: 2025-08-12

## Overview

Implement a secure user authentication system that allows students to register, login, and manage their credentials for automated English class registration at schoolpack.smart.edu.co. This system will provide the foundation for storing user credentials securely and enabling the automated registration process.

## User Stories

### Student Registration

As an English student, I want to create an account with my schoolpack.smart.edu.co credentials, so that the system can automatically register me for classes.

Students will provide their username, password, and preferences during registration. The system will securely encrypt and store these credentials, validate them against the schoolpack platform, and create a user profile for automated registration.

### Secure Login

As a registered student, I want to login to my account securely, so that I can manage my preferences and view my registration status.

Students will authenticate using email/username and password. The system will provide session management, remember me functionality, and secure logout capabilities.

### Credential Management

As a student, I want to update my schoolpack.smart.edu.co credentials safely, so that the automation system continues working if I change my password.

Students can update their stored credentials through a secure interface. The system will validate new credentials and update the encrypted storage.

## Spec Scope

1. **User Registration** - Account creation with email, password, and schoolpack credentials
2. **Authentication** - Secure login/logout with session management  
3. **Credential Storage** - Encrypted storage of schoolpack.smart.edu.co credentials
4. **User Management** - Profile editing, password changes, account settings
5. **Integration Points** - Connect with existing UserPreference model and future automation system

## Out of Scope

- Password reset via email (will be added in Phase 3)
- Two-factor authentication
- Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Admin user roles and permissions
- Account deletion/deactivation workflows

## Expected Deliverable

1. Students can successfully register accounts and login to the SmartAcademy system
2. Schoolpack.smart.edu.co credentials are securely encrypted and stored in MongoDB
3. Authentication system integrates seamlessly with existing UserPreference model
