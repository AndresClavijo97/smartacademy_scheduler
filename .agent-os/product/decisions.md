## 2025-08-12: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

SmartAcademy will be an automated English class registration system targeting students at schoolpack.smart.edu.co who struggle with limited class availability. The system will use web automation to register classes at 6am daily when slots open.

### Context

Students at smart.edu.co face significant challenges securing English class spots due to limited availability and early opening times (6am). Manual registration creates stress and often results in missed classes, affecting academic progress.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Registration Helper**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, less automation complexity
   - Cons: Still requires user intervention, doesn't solve core problem

2. **API Integration**
   - Pros: More reliable, faster execution
   - Cons: No public API available for schoolpack.smart.edu.co

### Rationale

Web automation with Selenium provides the only viable solution given platform limitations while completely solving the user problem through full automation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete automation eliminates need for early wake-ups
- Higher success rate for class registration
- Reduced student stress and improved academic continuity

**Negative:**
- Higher technical complexity due to web scraping
- Potential brittleness if platform UI changes
- Dependency on external website availability

## 2025-08-12: Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement layered design architecture with Rails 8, MongoDB, and specialized object organization including value objects, page objects, and namespaced components.

### Context

Need robust, maintainable architecture for web automation system with complex domain logic and external dependencies.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Rails MVC**
   - Pros: Faster initial development, familiar patterns
   - Cons: Poor separation of concerns for complex automation logic

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Pros: Better scalability, service isolation
   - Cons: Overengineering for current scope, increased complexity

### Rationale

Layered design provides optimal balance of maintainability, testability, and domain modeling while staying within Rails conventions.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Highly testable and maintainable code
- Domain-driven design principles

**Negative:**
- Steeper learning curve for team
- More initial setup complexity
