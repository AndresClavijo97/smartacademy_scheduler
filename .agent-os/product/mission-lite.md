# Product Mission (Lite)

SmartAcademy is an English class registration automator that helps students secure spots in limited classes by providing automatic registration at 6am when schedules open.

SmartAcademy serves English students at schoolpack.smart.edu.co who struggle with limited class availability that fills up quickly. Unlike manual registration, SmartAcademy completely automates the process using Selenium WebDriver and provides intelligent schedule configuration specific to the educational platform.
